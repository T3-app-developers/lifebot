 kxr84k-codex/create-houses-with-babylon.js-in-deployment
A simple Babylon.js scene with three cube houses lined up on a flat ground. Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the world in first-person view. Use **WASD** (or the arrow keys) to walk around. Click inside the canvas to lock the pointer and look around; press **Esc** to release it. Each house contains a sink—click it to see the silver faucet rotate while blue water flows out. The ground is green and the houses use a brick-colored material.

The code is now organized so new gameplay features can be added easily. A basic shop building appears a short walk in front of the houses and the UI shows the player’s current coin count.
