# Lifebot

An example Babylon.js scene with three cube houses lined up on a flat ground. Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the world in first-person view. Use **WASD** (or the arrow keys) to walk around. Click inside the canvas to lock the pointer and look around; press **Esc** to release it. Each house contains a sinkâ€”click it to see the silver faucet rotate while blue water flows out. The ground is green and the houses use a brick-colored material.

To deploy on Netlify, push this repository and point your Netlify site at the repository root. No build step is required.
